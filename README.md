# Stock_prediction
Predicting Higher/Lower highs/lows for the given stock data

1. Partition the data for training and testing.  Using straightforward Python, find the higher/lower highs and higher/lower lows with a 5 back + 5 ahead rolling window.  (Note that 5 bars must pass before the higher/lower highs/lows are known.)  Use deep learning to train a system so that it correctly identifies HH, HL, LL, and LH prices and times in the test data.  

2. Design version 2 that attempts to predict when the HL and LH will occur at least 1 bar ahead of the 5 bar lag and provide an analysis of its performance.
